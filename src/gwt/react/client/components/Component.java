/**
 * <p>You can subclass {@link Component} to define a stateful, ES6-style React component</p>
 *
 * <p>To create a {@link ReactElement} based on this component, call {@link React#createElement(Class, BaseProps, ReactElement...)}.
 * In cases where  you have exported a Component in JavaScript under a name that does not match its Java name, or you have
 * disabled class meta data, you cannot use a Class reference. Instead, pass the result of calling
 * ComponentUtils.getCtorFn(Fully qualified name) e.g.</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * React.createElement(ComponentUtils.getCtorFn("SomeComponentName"), someProps, ReactElement...)
 * </pre>
 *
 * In addition to the methods defined in this class, you can also define the following lifecyle methods as needed:
 *
 * <Pre>
 * void componentWillMount()
 * void componentDidMount()
 * void componentWillReceiveProps(P nextProps)
 * boolean shouldComponentUpdate(P nextProps, S nextState)
 * void componentWillUpdate(P nextProps, S nextState)
 * void componentDidUpdate(P prevProps, S prevState)
 * void componentWillUnmount()
 * </Pre>
 * 
 * <p>To have extra type safety when defining some of the above methods, you can implement one or more of the following interfaces:</p>
 * <p>{@link ComponentWillMount}</p> 
 * <p>{@link ComponentDidMount}</p> 
 * <p>{@link ComponentWillReceiveProps}</p>
 * <p>{@link ShouldComponentUpdate}</p>
 * <p>{@link ComponentWillUpdate}</p>
 * <p>{@link ComponentDidUpdate}</p>
 * <p>{@link ComponentWillUnmount}</p>
 * 
 * @param <P> the type of props this component expects
 * @param <S> the type of state this component maintains

     * state, it returns the same result each time it's invoked, and it does not read from
     * or write to the DOM or otherwise interact with the browser (e.g., by using setTimeout).
     * If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in {@link ComponentDidMount#componentDidMount()} or

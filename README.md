# gwt-react
GWT Java bindings for React

##Introduction

gwt-react provides Java [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/) bindings for [React v15.0.1](https://facebook.github.io/react/) based on the
new JsInterop capabilities introduced in GWT 2.8

***Please note: the project currently depends on a Snapshot build of GWT 2.8 to work. Consider this project a preview. The API is highly likely to change.***

##Prerequisites

Any documentation assumes you are familiar with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). If this is not the case, please take the time
to learn the basic concepts first. Check out the resources section for useful links.

You should also be familiar with the GWT 2.8 JsInterop specification. You can find the specification
[here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10fmlEYIHcyead_4R1S5wKGs1t2I7Fnp_PaNaa7XTEk0/edit#heading=h.o7amqk9edhb9)

##Getting Started

Please take a look at the [gwt-react-examples](https://github.com/GWTReact/gwt-react-examples) project for
details on how to use the library.

##Documentation

Check out the [Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/GWTReact/gwt-react/wiki). There are a number of important concepts specific
to **gwt-react** that may not be obvious, even if you are an experienced GWT developer.

##Contributing

Once the project is stable we will be happy to except pull requests. If you find any problems please file issues.

##Roadmap

* Refine the different prop types for basic HTML elements

* Refine the CSS prop types and add enumerations and more useful setter methods where possible
